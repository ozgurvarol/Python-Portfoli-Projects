    "\n",
    "In this acitvity, you will work with **Adult Income Dataset** from UCI Machine Learning portal. The Adult Income data set has been used in many machine learning papers that address classification problems. You will read the data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame and do practice some of the advanced data wrangling you learned in this Lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "### URL for downloading the data\n",

    "Following are the details of the type of the attributes of this dataset for your reference. You may have to refer them while answering question on this activity. Note that, many of the attributes are of discrete factor type. These are common type for a classification problem unlike continuous numeric values used for regression problems.\n",

    "### A special note on the variable 'fnlwgt':\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights on the CPS files are controlled to independent estimates of the civilian noninstitutional population of the US.  These are prepared monthly for us by Population Division here at the Census Bureau.  We use 3 sets of controls. These are:\n",
    "1.  A single cell estimate of the population 16+ for each state.\n",
    "2.  Controls for Hispanic Origin by age and sex.\n",
    "3.  Controls by age and sex.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use all three sets of controls in our weighting program and \"rake\" through them 6 times so that by the end we come back to all the controls we used. The term estimate refers to population totals derived from CPS by creating \"weighted tallies\" of any specified socio-economic characteristics of the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "People with similar demographic characteristics should have similar weights. There is one important caveat to remember about this statement.  That is that since the CPS sample is actually a collection of 51 state samples, each with its own probability of selection, the statement only applies within state."
