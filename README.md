# PythonCorrelation

- Dataset ; https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies
- My hypothesis is there is a high correlation between gross and budget. I used Panda, seaborn, numpy, and matplolip to able to prove my hypothesis.
- I did data cleaning and formatting.
- I proved that gross and budget have a 0.75 correlation which is the highest correlation in the dataset.So, my hypothesis is right.
